# Valid Parentheses

## Problem Description

Given a string containing parentheses, brackets, and curly braces, the task is to determine if the input string is valid. The input string is considered valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every closing bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Approach and Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. The algorithm can be implemented as follows:

1. Create an empty stack to store the opening brackets encountered.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '[', or '{'), push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (')', ']', or '}'), perform the following checks:
   - If the stack is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket. Return False.
   - Pop the top element from the stack and compare it with the current closing bracket:
     - If the popped element does not match the closing bracket, return False.
     - If they match, continue to the next character.
5. After iterating through all the characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, all opening brackets have been matched and closed, so return True. Otherwise, return False as there are unmatched opening brackets remaining.

## Optimization

To optimize the algorithm, we can make the following improvements:

1. Instead of using a stack of characters, we can use a stack of integers to store the indices of opening brackets. This avoids the overhead of character comparisons.
2. We can utilize the ASCII values of the characters to perform bracket matching using integer comparisons, eliminating the need for a dictionary.
3. To further enhance performance, we can pre-allocate the stack with a fixed size based on the length of the input string. This reduces memory allocations during runtime.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through each character once.
The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as the stack can contain all opening brackets in the string.

## Summary

The valid parentheses problem can be efficiently solved using a stack-based approach. By carefully handling opening and closing brackets, we can determine the validity of the input string. The algorithm provides a time and space-efficient solution to the problem.
