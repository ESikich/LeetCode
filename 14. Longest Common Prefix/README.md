# Longest Common Prefix Solution

This repository contains an optimized solution to the problem of finding the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings, the task is to find the longest common prefix string among them. If there is no common prefix, the function should return an empty string.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

## Solution Approach

The goal is to optimize the function for speed while finding the longest common prefix. The solution presented here takes into account the constraints provided in the problem description.

To optimize for speed, the following approach is used:

1. Initialize the `prefix` variable with an empty string.
2. If the input `strs` is empty, return an empty string.
3. Iterate through the characters of the first string in `strs`.
4. For each character, iterate through the remaining strings in `strs` starting from the second string.
5. If the current character is not present in any of the strings or if the character at the same position in any string is different from the current character, return the `prefix` as the longest common prefix.
6. If all the characters match in all the strings at the current position, append the current character to the `prefix`.
7. Return the `prefix` as the longest common prefix.

This approach avoids unnecessary iterations and terminates as soon as it finds a character that doesn't match or when the prefix becomes empty. It runs in linear time, considering the length of the longest common prefix among the strings.

## Performance and Optimization

The solution presented here is optimized for speed by reducing unnecessary comparisons and iterations. It aims to achieve linear time complexity, considering the length of the longest common prefix among the strings.
